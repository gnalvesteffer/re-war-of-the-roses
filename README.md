# War of the Roses
A reverse-engineering effort to revive the discontinued live-service game "War of the Roses".

Built for wotr-beta.exe (War of the Roses Balance Beta).

## Installation
- Install the `War of the Roses Balance Beta`
- Create a shortcut to wotr.exe and add the following command line argument: `-bundle-dir bundle`
- Copy the following to your `War of the Roses Balance Beta` installation directory (should be named "War of the Roses Alpha"):
    - XorberaxMod.dll
- Use a DLL Injector (such as XenoInjector) to inject XorberaxMod.dll into the game on startup.
- If successful, a console should appear with the message `WotR Xorberax Mod Injected!`.
